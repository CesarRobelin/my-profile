        <p>
          I am a first year student at ESSEC, in the Global Bachelor of Business Administration. I study in Paris, France, and I just turned 19 🇫🇷.

          If I had to define myself quickly, I'm a hard-working, ambitious person, and I love discovering new things, like this coding course 📚!

          Also, I'm passionate about finance, business and travel, but I'll let you discover all that later on my profile 🎓!

          To finish quickly, I attached a link below to let you discover my favorite economics magazine: Les Echos! You will discover a lot of very interesting information and I hope you will like it ❤️.

      	<h2>Travel 🧳 ✈️</h2>
      	<p>
      		Traveling is a real passion for me. Indeed, I love to discover new regions of the world, countries, but especially different cultures. Since my childhood, I had the chance to travel around the world and to discover many wonderful countries, such as: the USA, Russia, Austria, Finland, Italy, England, etc...

        <h2>Finance 💵</h2>
        <p>
         Finance is, without a doubt, the field I am most passionate about, and the one I would like to work in later. Indeed, I am passionate about numbers and understanding the issues of large multinationals that surround us. Therefore, I would like to acquire real skills in this field that I particularly like. Finally, I find that finance is essential nowadays, as any organization needs to have a performing financial sector.

    	<h2>Cars 🚙</h2>
        <p>
          	I have been very interested in cars since I was a little boy. My parents passed on this passion for cars to me, and I love visiting museums that tell the fabulous story of these cars. I have a preference for supercars, and especially for Porsche, which is my favorite team! During the next few months, I will be very happy to attend the 24h of Le Mans, which is one of the most famous French car competitions in the world.

    	<h2>Internship 💼</h2>
        <p>
         	In order to validate our first year as a student at ESSEC, the school asks us to do an operational internship for a period of 3 to 4 months, and I am going to do my internship at Air Liquide, a French multinational company, listed on the CAC40 stock market index. I will be working in the "market analysis" branch, directly in Singapore, for 4 months. I am really looking forward to start working, especially in the field of finance which I really enjoy! It will be an extraordinary adventure!

    <div class="card-white">
    	<h2>Books 📚</h2>
        <p>
         	I am a big fan of literature, and it is a passion that occupies a significant part of my time. I particularly enjoy fantasy novels and biographies of some of the world's most famous politicians. I find that reading is important for self-development, but also for acquiring new knowledge in multiple fields!
